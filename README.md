# bankist Project

Application designed by Jonas Schmedtmann in his java script course. A flow chart and instructions were provided by the author.
Bankist, which stands for minimalist banking, shows an online banking interface for customers, who need to first log in with their username and password to be able to see their account. The account information includes movements, some summaries, interest rate, and allows simple transactions, like transfering money to another account, getting a loan or closing account.
The main focus here is working with functions, arrays, manipulating DOM elements, creating Dates, Timers(setTimeout, setInterval), using Internationalization with Numbers and Dates(Intl)
